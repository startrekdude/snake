         * If an error has occurred and the control flow has returned here,
         * rather than a more specific catch block, then we can't recover.
         * 
         * This is a bug; I've most likely made a mistake in an algorithm or
         * forgot to handle an Exception in something user-facing.
         * 
         * More specific exception and edge-case handlers exist where required, including in
         * the input-handling routines, among other locations.
         * 
         * If control flow is here, I've made a mistake, it's a bug, the program can't
         * recover.
         * 
         * Ergo, we:
         *     i) Cleanup: Close all open windows
         *    ii) Inform the user that a bug has occurred
         *   iii) Instruct them to inform the developer, providing:
         *    iv) The complete stacktrace that we print
         *     v) Cleanup: Exit the program
         * 
         * Additionally, since this is a graphical program, we inform the user
         * graphically using a JOptionPane.
         * 
         * This is harder than it sounds, as no-one
         * saw fit to include in the standard library a method to get a Throwable's stack
         * trace as a String; the stdlib only has a method to print said stack trace
         * to the console.
