A set of utilities that help to create Swing GUI elements
associated with specific Runnable's as their corresponding actions
Ex:
    ActionUtils->menu ("Save", CustomWindow::Save) returns a JMenuItem
    ActionUtils->button ("Save, CustomWindow::Save) returns a JButton
These items also print the name of the action invoked to the console, though
this behavior is configurable using printActions

static Boolean printActions is true
