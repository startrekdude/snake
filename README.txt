This file serves as an introduction to the documentation involved in the
implementation of Snake.
It also contains miscellaneous notes about Snake.

Notes:
    - I recommend playing Snake on Hard, the other modes seem a bit slow
      to me. But to each their own.
    - Sound effects are present.
    - Snake has an easter egg, accessible by typing the Konami Code; that
      is, "Up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, b, a".

Interesting documentation files:
    - README-HRT contains a description of the high-resolution timer
      component of Snake and the rationale behind it. It also explains why
      a very very small amount of Snake is implemented in C. (Windows only)
    - RUBRIC-REQUIREMENTS describes precisely where various rubric
      requirements are present in Snake. It also contains a section on
      "Evidence of Learning" (i.e. extra) features.

Other documentation files:
    - THIRD-PARTY contains references and licensing information for
      assets used by Snake that were made by a third party.
